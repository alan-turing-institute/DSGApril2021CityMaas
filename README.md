## Making travel in cities accessible for people with disabilities through prediction and personalisation. 
 
Overview: 
Travelling can be a challenging but rewarding activity especially for people with additional needs. One of the most challenging parts of daily life for disabled people is travel. Accessible travel is inefficient: on average people with limited mobility take 2.5 times longer to complete the same journey compared to able bodied people due to poor infrastructure, such as a lack of step-free access, and real-time accessibility information. Providing accurate information about the accessibility of locations they might visit and which route would best suit their personal needs and preferences thus poses a fascinating challenge for researchers. This supports people with disabilities not only in their daily lives but also allows for more independence and freedom. 
CityMaaS (https://www.citymaas.io/about) is a company that aims to address the needs of 1 billion disabled people globally in a way that provides strong social impact through scalable software-as-a-service (SaaS) business models. The CityMaaS Mobility Map  (https://demo.CityMaaS.io) uses algorithms that predict accessibility information for any point of interest and personalises routing to optimise the travel experience. The purpose of this project is to address both of these parts of the platform, by improving predictions of POI accessibility and the personalisation of routes. 
There are two main research questions of interest: prediction and routing. Participants are encouraged to organise themselves into working groups and explore the research question most interesting to them.
